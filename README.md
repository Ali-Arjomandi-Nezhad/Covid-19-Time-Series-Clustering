Following a crisis, it is extremely crucial to learn lessons from the experiences during the crisis. In this regard, the number of people infected with the Covid-19 virus should be carefully analyzed. It will be really difficult to realize which factors or decisions made by governments were the most effective for controlling the infection rates. To do so, I suggest that countries be clustered regarding their case to population time series. Then, the common policies or facilities of the countries in each cluster are identified as the most important factors that shape their infection trend.
As the first step, I write a Python code for clustering thirteen countries located in Europe.
